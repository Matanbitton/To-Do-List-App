## About The Project

GetToDo is a to do list App with a single objective in mind, Make to do lists fun!
I truly believe that we don't HAVE to do the things we do, We GET to do them.

With this app users can:

- Create To Dos With Specific Dates.

- Create Projects To Categorize To Dos.

- Filter To Dos By: Importance, Date, and State (wheter the to do is done or not).

- Save the to dos to their local machine.

## What I learned:

- The importance of SOLID principles and writing clean, maintainable and scalabe code.

- The MVC design pattern.

- How a CRUD app works.

- How to effectivly use e.target with event Listeners.

## What I struggled with:

I struggled at first to wrap my head around what each module should do.

I was confused on how each part of the project should commuinicate and send data to a different part.

And how to use localStorage since the documentation were a bit unclear for my use case.
